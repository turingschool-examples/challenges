# Basic Stack

A stack is a LIFO (last-in, first-out) data structure. The
core operations are `push` which adds an element to the stack
and `pop` with removes the top element of the stack.

## Challenge

Implement a `Stack` which can...

* `push` an element onto the stack
* `pop` remove the top element from the stack and return the element
* `count` the number of elements on the stack
* `peek` at the top element without removing it
* `max` find the largest value in the stack

You can assume that this stack only holds integers.

## Limitations

While you can use a Ruby `Array`, don't use the following built-in
methods on Array:

* `push` / `<<` / `unshift`
* `pop` / `shift`
* `max` / `max_by` / `min` / `min_by`
* `count` / `length`
* `first` / `last`

And, for an added challenge, can you do it without using
negative array indexes?
